## WHAT DOCKER IS?

Docker is a free and open set of software, delivering, and operating apps. Docker allows to decouple the apps from infrastructure to swiftly release software. We can organise our hardware the same approach we control our programs with Docker. We may drastically minimise the time between writing code and executing it in operation by leveraging Docker's approaches for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly. 

## HOW DOCKER WORKS

Docker helps to give users a consistent mechanism to run the code. Docker is a container operating system. Containers deploy a server's operating system in the same way as virtual machines virtualize which eliminate the need to handle server hardware directly. Each server has Docker installed, which provides simple commands for building, starting, and stopping containers.

## EXAMPLE OF DOCKER

For example, a website, API, and database must all be linked together. Docker Compose enables us to accomplish just that. We can make a file that specifies how containers are linked to one other. This file can be used to create all of the Dockerfiles for all of our containers in one go.

* **APACHE**

*Run the docker-compose up command in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml file to start running all of the specified services as Docker containers.*

*The Apache httpd Docker image becomes available on port 8080 once this docker-compose up command accomplishes, with the web server hosting files from the folder supplied in the configuration file's volumes section.*
