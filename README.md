## WHAT DOCKER IS?

Docker is a free and open set of software, delivering, and operating apps. Docker allows to decouple the apps from infrastructure to swiftly release software. You can organise your hardware the same approach you control your programs with Docker. You may drastically minimise the time between writing code and executing it in operation by leveraging Docker's approaches for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly. 

## HOW DOCKER WORKS

Docker helps to give users a consistent mechanism to run the code. Docker is a container operating system. Containers deploy a server's operating system in the same way as virtual machines virtualize (eliminate the need to handle server hardware directly). Each server has Docker installed, which provides simple commands for building, starting, and stopping containers.
